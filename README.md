# Bruce-cases
cases for Bruce (the keyboard)

Hull case is tested with Bruce V2 and fits with minimal usb c port poke.


The chonky case is a multi-piece construction case meant to give the option to build a super heavy board without having to buy a full cnc case. The mid layer can be ordered laser cut using the dxf. I would suggest making the midlayer a total of 10-12 millimeters thick to allow the pcb room to not bottom out. Screws go through the 3d printed bottom case to screw into m2 heatset inserts in the top case.
Chonky case is finished and tested with Bruce V2, fits with usb port fairly recessed, confirmed fitment with Netdot Gen10 cables. 


Both cases utilize the hull-style plate.
